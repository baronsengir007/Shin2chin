# Shin2Chin Betting Platform - Frontend

## Current Status: Phase 2-B Part 3 - Component Testing

### Project Overview
A Solana-based P2P betting platform built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The platform enables users to create and participate in betting events with non-custodial wallet integration.

### Architecture Progress

#### ✅ Phase 2-A: Layer 1 Core Foundation (Complete)
- Store architecture with Zustand
- Custom hooks for state management
- Base interfaces and types

#### ✅ Phase 2-B: Layer 2 State Management (Complete)
- Four specialized stores: wallet, betting, events, UI
- Store integration hooks
- State synchronization

#### 🔄 Phase 2-B Part 3: Component Testing (In Progress)
- Unit testing with Vitest and React Testing Library
- 82 total tests across 5 component test files
- 66% tests passing (54/82)
- Key issues identified in ProgressiveDisclosure and CategorySelector components

### Testing Results Summary

| Component | Status | Tests Passing | Issues |
|-----------|--------|---------------|---------|
| OddsConfiguration | ✅ | 14/14 | None |
| EventCreationForm | ✅ | 14/14 | None |
| MinimalLayout | ✅ | 20/20 | Fixed import issues |
