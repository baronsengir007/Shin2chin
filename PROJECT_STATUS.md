# Shin2Chin Project Status

## Fresh Start - January 30, 2025

### Current Phase: Phase A - Foundation
**Status**: Starting
**Progress**: 0%

### Phase A Objectives
1. **Event Account Structure** - Complete Event PDA with all required fields
2. **Create Event Instruction** - Admin can create betting events  
3. **Bet Account Structure** - Individual bet tracking with escrow
4. **Place Bet Instruction** - Users can place bets on events
5. **Basic Matching Logic** - Simple 1:1 bet matching for MVP

### What We're Building
- Minimum Viable Betting Platform (MVBP)
- Admin creates events via Solana program
- Users place binary bets (Team A vs Team B)
- Simple 1:1 matching initially
- Manual settlement for MVP
