# Shin2Chin Betting Platform: Foundation Prompt

## Project Overview

Shin2Chin is a peer-to-peer betting platform for combat sports/fighting matches built on the Ethereum/Base blockchain. It allows users to place bets on fighters in scheduled matches, with bets automatically matched between opposing sides. The platform handles fight creation, bet matching, result submission, and automated payout distribution, all while maintaining the security of user funds.

The platform's core value proposition is its P2P betting mechanism - users bet against each other rather than against a house, with the platform taking only a small fee on winnings. This creates a more equitable betting experience while ensuring the platform's sustainability through fee collection.

## Architecture

### Current Architecture

The current implementation uses a single upgradeable smart contract with the following components:

1. **Fight Management**: Creates and stores fight information, including fighters, start times, and states
2. **Betting System**: Handles bet placement with a consolidated array-based storage mechanism
3. **P2P Matching Engine**: Matches bets from opposing sides automatically
4. **Admin-Based Result Submission**: Allows admins to submit and finalize fight results
5. **Settlement System**: Automatically distributes payouts and refunds after result submission
6. **Fund Management**: Handles user deposits and withdrawals using USDT tokens
7. **Admin Controls**: Manages platform operation with appropriate access controls

The contract leverages OpenZeppelin's upgradeability pattern, allowing future improvements without losing state.

### Target Simplified Architecture

The redesign maintains the single-contract architecture but further simplifies components while preserving core P2P functionality:

1. **Storage Optimization**: 
   - Optimized structs with packed variables to reduce gas costs
   - Simplified state transitions with minimal enumeration
   - Consolidated bet storage and matching logic

2. **Process Streamlining**:
   - Direct admin result submission (no oracle complexity)
   - Immediate settlement upon result submission
   - Simplified security model with primary and backup admins

3. **Enhanced Event System**:
   - Detailed event emissions for frontend synchronization
   - Clear tracking of all state changes and financial transactions

4. **Gas Efficiency**:
   - Batch processing for bet matching
   - Optimized storage layouts
   - Efficient iteration patterns

## Core Use Cases

### Priority 1: Betting Workflow
1. User deposits USDT tokens to platform balance
2. User views available fights and odds
3. User places bet on Fighter A or Fighter B
4. System matches bet with opposing bets
5. After fight concludes, system automatically:
   - Pays out winners (matched bet amount Ã— 2, minus small fee)
   - Refunds any unmatched portion of bets

### Priority 2: Fight Management
1. Admin creates fight with fighters, scheduled time
2. System automatically closes betting before fight starts
3. Admin submits fight result after conclusion
4. System finalizes result and distributes payouts
5. Admin can view platform statistics and fee collection

### Priority 3: Fund Management
1. User deposits funds to platform balance
2. User places bets using platform balance
3. User receives winnings to platform balance
4. User withdraws funds to external wallet
5. Admin can perform emergency functions in critical situations

## Coding Standards

### Architecture Patterns
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear delineation between fight management, betting, and fund handling
- **Minimalism**: Only implement what's necessary for core functionality
- **Gas Optimization**: Storage packing, efficient loops, batch processing
- **Defensive Programming**: Validate all inputs, handle edge cases
- **Fail Early**: Check preconditions at the start of functions

### Security Considerations
- **Access Control**: Clear role-based restrictions on administrative functions
- **Fund Security**: Reentrancy protection on all financial transactions
- **Input Validation**: Thorough validation of all user inputs
- **Emergency Measures**: Pause functionality and admin recovery options
- **Upgradeability**: Carefully managed state variables for proxy compatibility

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Testing**: Each component tested in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflows tested
- **Gas Reporting**: Track gas costs for optimization
- **Coverage**: Aim for >90% test coverage

## Implementation Guidelines

### Key Principles
1. **Simplicity Over Complexity**: 
   - Choose the simplest approach that satisfies requirements
   - Avoid premature optimization or unnecessary features
   - Maintain readability over clever code

2. **Security First**:
   - Consider attack vectors for every function
   - Apply consistent security patterns
   - Never trust external inputs

3. **Gas Efficiency**:
   - Optimize storage layout
   - Minimize state changes
   - Batch operations where possible

4. **Clear Documentation**:
   - NatSpec comments for all functions
   - Event emissions for all state changes
   - Thorough documentation of assumptions and limitations

5. **Future-Proofing**:
   - Maintain upgradeability compatibility
   - Use constants for configurable values
   - Design with extensibility in mind

### Implementation Approach
- Follow the phased implementation plan from the project board
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage throughout development
- Regularly review gas costs and optimize as needed
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Prioritize core P2P betting functionality over peripheral features

This foundation prompt provides the essential context for developing the Shin2Chin betting platform, focusing on maintaining the core P2P betting functionality while simplifying the architecture and ensuring security and gas efficiency.
