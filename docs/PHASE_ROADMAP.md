---

### Phase B: Integration (Weeks 4-6)
**Primary Focus:** MVBP (Minimum Viable Betting Platform) with wallet connection
**Success Criteria:** Working MVBP with real wallets on testnet
**Target:** First real bet through wallet

#### MVBP Definition
- Admin creates events via web interface
- Users connect wallet and place binary bets
- Simple 1:1 matching system
- Manual settlement process
- Basic but functional UI

#### Development Focus
- **Solana Stream:** Integration testing, testnet deployment
- **Frontend Stream:** Wallet adapter integration, real Anchor client
- **Both:** End-to-end integration testing

#### Deliverables
- Working demo with real wallet connections
- First successful bet placement and settlement
- MVBP ready for user testing

---

### Phase C: Core Features (Weeks 7-10)
**Primary Focus:** Gary AI + User Stories 1&3 implementation
**Success Criteria:** All core user stories functional

#### Parallel Development
- **Solana Stream:** Advanced business logic, optimization
- **Frontend Stream:** Gary AI integration, UX polish
- **Support Stream:** Comprehensive testing, documentation

#### Key Features
- Gary AI conversational betting interface
- User Story 1: Basic betting flow
- User Story 3: Advanced betting features
- Real-time updates and notifications
- Enhanced UI/UX

#### Deliverables
- Fully functional Gary AI
- Complete implementation of core user stories
- Polished user interface
- Real-time betting experience

---

### Phase D: Advanced (Weeks 11-13)
**Primary Focus:** Oracle integration + Full automation
**Success Criteria:** All 5 user stories on mainnet

#### Advanced Features
- Oracle integration for automated settlement
- HeyAnon SDK integration
- Full platform automation
- Mainnet deployment preparation

#### Final Implementation
- User Stories 4&5 completion
- Advanced trading features
- Production monitoring and logging
- Security audits and testing

#### Deliverables
- Production-ready platform
- All user stories implemented
- Mainnet deployment
- Full documentation and support

- **Documentation/Testing:** 10%

### Phase B (Weeks 4-6)
- **Integration Work:** 60%
- **Frontend Development:** 30%
- **Testing/QA:** 10%

### Phase C (Weeks 7-10)
- **Frontend/AI:** 50%
- **Solana Advanced:** 30%
- **Testing/Documentation:** 20%

### Phase D (Weeks 11-13)
- **Advanced Features:** 40%
- **Production Preparation:** 35%
- **Security/Audit:** 25%

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Dependency Management:** Phase gates ensure prerequisites are met
- **Integration Challenges:** Early integration in Phase B reduces late-stage issues
- **Solana Complexity:** Dedicated focus in Phase A builds solid foundation

### Project Risks
- **Scope Creep:** MVBP definition maintains focus on essential features
- **Timeline Pressure:** Parallel streams maximize efficiency
- **Resource Constraints:** Clear phase boundaries enable proper planning

### Quality Risks
- **Testing Coverage:** Continuous testing throughout all phases
- **Security Issues:** Dedicated security focus in Phase D
- **User Experience:** Early user feedback from MVBP in Phase B

---

## Success Metrics

### Weekly Milestones
- **Week 3:** Working event creation end-to-end
- **Week 6:** First real bet through wallet
- **Week 9:** Gary AI conversation working
- **Week 12:** All user stories functional
- **Week 13:** Full platform mainnet ready

### Quality Gates
- Each phase requires sign-off before proceeding
- Technical demos at 3-week intervals
- User feedback incorporation points
- Security review checkpoints

## Benefits of Phase-Based Approach

1. **2x Development Efficiency** through parallel streams
2. **Working Demo in 6 Weeks** for early validation
3. **Early User Feedback** capability with MVBP
4. **Risk Reduction** through incremental validation
5. **Timeline Predictability** with clear phase gates
6. **Resource Optimization** with focused development streams

This roadmap provides a clear path from the current 34% complete state to a fully functional betting platform, addressing the critical 85% missing Solana logic bottleneck while enabling parallel development progress.
