# Implementation Status

## Programs

### Betting Program (/programs/betting)
- ✅ Basic structure and account definitions
- ❌ Missing instruction implementations
- ❌ Missing create_event.rs, place_bet.rs, submit_result.rs
- ⚠️ State structures defined but not integrated

### Oracle Program (/programs/oracle)  
- ✅ Instruction files exist
- ❌ EventAccount not properly defined
- ❌ Integration with betting program needed

## Frontend

### App (/app)
- ✅ React structure setup
- ❌ Gary AI integration (SDK missing)
- ⚠️ Program integration started but incomplete

### Admin (/admin)
- ✅ Basic structure
- ❌ No implementation yet

## Tests
- ⚠️ Framework exists, minimal implementation
- ❌ Missing actual test logic for instructions
- ❌ Integration tests contain only placeholders

## Component Details

### Betting Program
- **State**: Account structures (Event, Bet) are defined but not fully utilized
- **Instructions**: 
  - `create_event`: Stubbed, only logs message
  - `place_bet`: Stubbed, only logs message
  - `submit_result`: Stubbed, only logs message
- **Errors**: Error definitions exist but not fully utilized

### Oracle Program
- **State**: Oracle account defined, but EventAccount is referenced without proper definition
- **Instructions**:
  - `register_oracle`: Partially implemented
  - `submit_result`: Partially implemented
- **Integration**: Missing proper integration with betting program

### Frontend Components
- **Gary AI Service**: 
  - Interface defined for BettingIntent
  - HeyAnon SDK import commented out
  - Methods contain placeholder implementations
- **Betting Service**:
  - Basic structure for program integration
  - Methods contain placeholder implementations

### SDK
- **Basic structure** exists but incomplete implementation
- **Type definitions** need to be aligned with program accounts

## Next Implementation Tasks

1. Implement betting program instruction handlers:
   - Create proper instruction files (create_event.rs, place_bet.rs, submit_result.rs)
   - Implement actual logic for each instruction

2. Fix EventAccount in oracle program:
   - Properly define EventAccount or use consistent reference to betting program's Event account
   - Ensure proper integration between oracle and betting programs

3. Complete Gary AI integration:
   - Integrate actual HeyAnon SDK
   - Implement conversation flow with betting intent detection

4. Build admin interface:
   - Implement oracle management UI
   - Implement event management UI

5. Write comprehensive tests:
   - Unit tests for each instruction
   - Integration tests for end-to-end betting workflow
