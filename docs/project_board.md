# Shin2Chin Platform Redesign: Project Board

## Project Overview

This project board tracks the phases, tasks, dependencies, progress, and timeline for the Shin2Chin platform redesign initiative. The redesign focuses on simplifying the architecture while maintaining core P2P betting functionality that fulfills our three user stories:

- 🎲 **[Bettor]** - As a bettor, I want to place bets on fighters in scheduled matches so that I can earn money if my prediction is correct.
- 🛡️ **[Admin]** - As a platform admin, I want to manage fights and control platform operations so that users can bet on legitimate matches and the platform runs securely.
- 💰 **[Operator]** - As a platform operator, I want to collect fees on winning bets so that the platform can sustainably operate while providing a fair P2P betting experience.

Each task is tagged with the user stories it supports to ensure clear traceability between development work and user needs.

```
Current Progress: Phase 1 completed. Base Blockchain Migration in progress. Phase 2 pending.
```
