# Shin2Chin Foundation Sprint Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the outcomes of the Foundation Sprint aimed at addressing critical infrastructure gaps identified in Task 1.1. The sprint focused on establishing the core development environment, installing project dependencies, and implementing foundational architecture components necessary for subsequent development tasks.

## Sprint Objectives

The Foundation Sprint was organized into three key phases:

1. **Core Development Tools** - Installing Rust, Solana CLI, and Anchor Framework
2. **Project Dependencies** - Installing dependencies for root, app, and admin components
3. **Architecture Foundations** - Implementing oracle program structure and test templates

## Accomplishments

### Phase 1: Core Development Tools

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| F1.1: Install Rust and Cargo | ✅ Complete | Successfully installed Rust 1.87.0 and Cargo 1.87.0 |
| F1.2: Install Solana CLI | ⚠️ Partial | Encountered network error (525) when downloading installer |
| F1.3: Install Anchor Framework | ⚠️ Pending | Dependent on Solana CLI installation |

**Key Findings:**
- Rust installation on Windows requires environment variable refresh for tools to be accessible
- Windows PowerShell requires different command chaining syntax (`;<command>` instead of `&&<command>`)
- Solana CLI download encountered network issues that need to be resolved

### Phase 2: Project Dependencies

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| F2.1: Install Root Dependencies | ⏳ In Progress | npm install initiated but not confirmed complete |
| F2.2: Install App Dependencies | ⏳ In Progress | npm install initiated but not confirmed complete |
| F2.3: Install Admin Dependencies | ⚠️ Partial | Initially failed with version error, then fixed |

**Critical Issue Resolution:**
- Identified and fixed critical Anchor version incompatibility (0.28.0 → 0.27.0) across all package.json files
- Updated all three package.json files to ensure consistent versioning

### Phase 3: Architecture Foundations

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| F3.1: Define Oracle Program Structure | ✅ Complete | Implemented complete Oracle program structure |
| F3.2: Create Test Templates | ✅ Complete | Created comprehensive unit and integration tests |
| F3.3: Validate Build Process | ⚠️ Pending | Dependent on dependency installation completion |

**Architecture Implementations:**
- Created full Oracle program with proper Anchor structure:
  - Program entry point with instruction handlers
  - Error definitions for all potential failure cases
  - State management with account structures
  - Instruction handlers for oracle registration and result submission
- Implemented SDK interfaces for betting and oracle programs
- Created comprehensive test templates covering all core functionality

## Issues and Resolutions

### Critical Issues

| Issue | Resolution | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Anchor version 0.28.0 unavailable | Updated to 0.27.0 across all package.json files | ✅ Fixed |
| Rust not in PATH after installation | Added Cargo bin directory to PATH | ✅ Fixed |
| Solana CLI download error (525) | Documented in INSTALLATION_PROGRESS.md, alternative needed | ⚠️ Pending |
| Command syntax differences in Windows | Modified commands to use PowerShell syntax | ✅ Fixed |

### Environment-Specific Considerations

Special considerations for Windows environments:
1. PowerShell uses `;` instead of `&&` for command chaining
2. Environment variables require explicit refresh after installation
3. Paths use backslashes instead of forward slashes
4. Curl command syntax differs from Unix environments

## Next Steps

To complete the Foundation Sprint and prepare for Task 1.2, the following actions are required:

1. **Dependency Installation**:
   - Confirm completion of npm install processes
   - Verify node_modules directories exist in all components

2. **Solana Tools Installation**:
   - Resolve Solana CLI download issue using alternative methods
   - Install Anchor CLI once Solana is installed

3. **Build Validation**:
   - Run `anchor build` to verify program compilation
   - Run `anchor test` to validate test framework

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update INSTALLATION_PROGRESS.md with final status
   - Document Windows-specific setup procedures

## Conclusion

The Foundation Sprint has made significant progress in establishing the development environment and implementing core architectural components. Critical dependency issues have been identified and resolved, and the Oracle program structure has been fully implemented according to Anchor best practices.

While some installation challenges remain to be resolved, the project structure is now well-defined and follows best practices for Solana development. The updated package.json files with compatible dependency versions should allow for successful installation and build processes once completed.
