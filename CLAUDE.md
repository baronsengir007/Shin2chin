## 🏗️ Architecture: Auto-Balancing Pool

### Why Pool (not P2P)
- P2P matching = too complex
- Pool = everyone bets against the pot
- Auto-balance = always 50-50 at start

### How It Works
1. Users bet on Team A or Team B
2. At match start: auto-balance to 50-50
3. LIFO refunds (last bets refunded first)
4. Winners get 1.95x (2x minus 2.5% fee)

### Technical Implementation
- Accept all bets during betting period
- At match_start_time: calculate imbalance
- Refund excess from larger pool (LIFO based on timestamp)
- Result: perfectly balanced pools
- Payout: fixed 1.95x for all winners

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Zustand, Vite
- **Backend**: Solana, Anchor Framework
- **Wallet**: Phantom
- **UI**: TailwindCSS, Minimal components
- **Deploy**: Devnet → Mainnet

## 📊 Development Phases (MCP Guide)
- Phase 0: Product Strategy ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 1: Architecture ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 2: Implementation 🚧 CURRENT
- Phase 3: UX Polish ⏳ TODO
- Phase 4: Security ⏳ TODO
- Phase 5: Testing ⏳ TODO

## 🚨 Current Status
**PROBLEM**: Backend is P2P, needs to be Pool
**SOLUTION**: Refactor to auto-balancing pool
**IMPACT**: 2 weeks of work
**PRIORITY**: Backend refactor → Frontend simplification → Integration
